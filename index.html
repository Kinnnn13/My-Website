One of the concepts built by them was the Lamborghini Calà, built to replace the Lamborghini Jalpa and was displayed at the 1995 Geneva Motor Show.After the Volkswagen Group took hold of the company in 1998, the Lamborghini Gallardo was built on the basis of the Calà and had many features absorbed from the concept car such as the exterior design and the traditional V10 engine.The car name is taken from the 18th century Spanish bullfighting breeder Francisco Gallardo. It means "gallant".</p2>
